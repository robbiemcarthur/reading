# Technical Decision Journal & Reference

A living record of technical trade-offs and architectural reasoning. The goal is to move from unconscious competence to articulate competence — not just knowing what good looks like, but being able to explain *why* and defend it.

## How to Use This

**Daily practice:** When you make a technical decision (at work or on GigLedger), write a short entry. Capture: what you decided, what the alternatives were, and why you chose what you chose. Three sentences is enough.

**Before design reviews:** Skim the relevant sections to prime your reasoning. If you're reviewing a PR that introduces inheritance, glance at the composition vs. inheritance entry.

**When challenged:** This is your reference. When someone asks "why not just use a HashMap here?" you can articulate the trade-off clearly.

**Over time:** Patterns will emerge. Those become your architectural principles — backed by real examples.
