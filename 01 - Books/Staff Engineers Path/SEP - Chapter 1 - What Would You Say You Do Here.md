# Chapter 1: What Would You Say You Do Here?

**Part:** I — The Big Picture
**Key Topics:** Defining the staff engineer role, the three pillars (big-picture thinking, project execution, levelling up), understanding your scope, shape, and primary focus

## Key Sections

- You're not a manager, but you are a leader
- You're in a "technical" role
- You aim to be autonomous
- You set technical direction
- You communicate often and well
- Understanding your role: scope, shape, and primary focus

## My Notes

The three pillars of the IC track are: big picture thinking, project execution and levelling up 

*Big Picture Thinking*

*Why do we need engineers who can see the **Big Picture***?
- Engineering organisations are constantly making *technical decisions*
	- Good *technical decisions* require *context* 
		- The context of a decision requires knowing the pros and cons of technology as well as local details, such as understanding *why* you are doing something, how much time, money and patience it'll require and what the risk tolerance is
		- Requiring context is difficult, and time consuming and we're often only focussed on our local scope, rather than how what we're doing ties in to the organisation's goals, if it does at all. 
		- *The local maximum* means the best decision for a single group, but this may not necessarily be the best decision for the organisation, or wider team. 
		- To avoid the local maxima, teams need decision makers to see the *big picture*
			- i.e. how will this decision affect other teams and stakeholders? 
			- SE's need to align technical strategy across teams and make the best decisions for the group as a whole 
		- Managers can't do this, they need to manage people, engineers need to build context and authority to set technical direction 

*Why do we need engineers to lead across multiple teams?*

- Need to be able to see dependencies across teams and the impact of one team's decision on another. 
- Teams are great at making excellent local decisions, but to keep a project moving we need someone who takes ownership for the project as a whole from a tech pov. 
- They'll be responsible for the high level system design, engineering standards, anticipating risks and asking hard questions, mentoring and coaching and seeing a good example for leads of other parts of the project. 

*Why do we need engineers who are a good influence?*

- Software matters, if it is sloppily done it can lead to tragic and catastrophic consequences, just look at Wikipedia's list of software bugs. 
	- Need people with experience that know what works and what doesn't and will take responsibility for creating good software. 
	- Conducting code and design review, providing architectural best practices, creating tools to make others jobs easier. 
	- Creating a psychologically safe environment and culture of learning and failing together. 

*You're not a manager but you are a leader*

- You need to be a leader - your job will be to take on large scale projects that can't succeed without collaboration, communication and alignment. 
- Not responsible for managing directs though e.g. holiday planning
- Leading in the form of: 
	- Designing happy path solutions to protect other engineers from common mistakes 
	- Reviewing other engineers code and designs in a way that *improves their confidence and skills*
	- Or highlighting that a design proposal genuinely doesn't meet a business need. 
	- Setting tech direction, inspiring others and raising their game are all examples of tech leadership. 

*You're in a technical role*

- You need to be a good technical influence by having high standards for what excellent engineering looks like and modelling them when you build something
- Your review of code and designs should be instructive for colleagues and should make your codebase or architecture better. 
- When you're making technical decisions, you need to understand the trade offs and help others understand them too. 
- You need to be able to dive into the details and ask the right questions / understand the answers
- A solid foundation of tech skills is essential 

*You aim to be autonomous*

- It's on you to decide what is important and what tasks require your time, along with your manager - 2 way convo 

*You set technical direction*

- Your technical decisions on architecture, storage, tools and frameworks 
- Your job is to make sure those decisions get made, get made well and are documented 
- You don't need to come up with all aspects of a decision but do need to ensure there is an agreed upon, well understood solution that solves the problem it sets out to solve. 

*You communicate often and well*

- Almost everything you do will be conveying information from your brain to other people's brain and vice versa. The better you are at being understood, the better you'll be at your job.

Manager vs SE responsibilities 

- Managers cannot consume the job of a technical lead because managing people in itself is a full time job. 
- Setting technical strategy by going deep and building context to make the best decision for whole groups is only possible by separating these paths

*Quotes*

*On why we need to see the Big Picture*
- "Someone who's investing in being a good people manager will have less time to keep up with technical developments, and anyone managing to stay deeply in the weeds will be less able to meet the needs of their reports."
- "You get better outcomes and designs if experienced engineers have the time to go deep and build the context and authority to set technical strategy. "
## How This Applies at SAS
*How does this map to your tech lead role?*

- Seeing the big picture will be very important as I step into tech lead role as I'll need to see outside the local maxima to understand how decisions I take within my team will affect others, and how aligned that'll be with the organisation as a whole. Ultimately my job is to make good technical decisions for SAS, not for my local team. I'll need to be able to step back to see the full picture.
