# Missing Books — Priority Order

Based on your IC career track, here's the priority ranking:

## 1. Staff Engineer — Will Larson (HIGH)
The companion to Tanya Reilly's book. Reilly tells you *how to operate*, Larson gives concrete examples through interviews with people who've done it. Read in Phase 4 (Weeks 18-19) once you've had a few months at SAS to contextualise the advice.

## 2. Team Topologies — Skelton & Pais (MEDIUM-HIGH)
Becomes more relevant once you're established at SAS and start influencing team structure and work flow. Quite short — readable in a week. Slot into ongoing reading after the 20 weeks or swap into Phase 4 if a week feels light.

## 3. Building Microservices — Sam Newman, 2nd ed (MEDIUM)
You already have significant microservices experience from Barclays and JP Morgan. The 2nd edition covers service mesh, Kubernetes-native patterns, and updated thinking on when *not* to use microservices. Skim it, focus on chapters covering things you haven't done hands-on.

## 4. Fundamentals of Software Architecture — Richards & Ford (LOWER)
Between DDIA, the Staff Engineer books, and your practical experience, you'll cover most of the same ground. Useful for structured vocabulary around architecture trade-offs ("fitness functions", "architecture quantum"). Park for later.
